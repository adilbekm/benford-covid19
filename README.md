# Benford's Law Applied to COVID-19 Case Reports #

Numbers that represent real-life events follow a certain regularity. Specifically, the first digit of these numbers is distributed non-uniformly with the number 1 appearing about 30% of the time, the number 2 about 18% of the time, and etc. having a frequency that declines in a logarithmic way. This pattern is known as the Benford's Law, and it can be used to identify fraud and other irregularities with reported numbers.

In this project, I applied Benford's Law to the reported numbers of COVID-19 cases around the world to see how well the numbers fit the expected pattern.
